;;;; UCD accessor functions

;;; The character database is made of several arrays.
;;; **CHARACTER-MISC-DATABASE** is an array of bytes that encode character
;;; attributes. Each entry in the misc database is +misc-width+ (currently 8)
;;; bytes wide. Within each entry, the bytes represent: general category, BIDI
;;; class, canonical combining class, digit value, decomposition info, other
;;; flags, script, line break class, and age, respectively. Several of the
;;; entries have additional information encoded in them at the bit level. The
;;; digit value field is equal to 128 (has only its high bit set) if characters
;;; with that set of attribute are not digits. Bit 6 is set if that entry
;;; encodes decimal digits, that is, characters that are DIGIT-CHAR-P. The rest
;;; of the value is the digit value of characters with that entry. Decomposition
;;; info contains the length of the decomposition of characters with that entry,
;;; and also sets its high bit if the decompositions are compatibility
;;; decompositions. The other flags byte encodes boolean properties. Bit 7 is
;;; set if the entry's characters are BOTH-CASE-P in the Common Lisp sense. Bit
;;; 6 is set if the entry's characters hav a defined case transformation in
;;; Unicode. Bit 5 is set if the characters have the property BIDI_Mirrored=Y.
;;; Bits 3-0 encode the entry's East Asian Width. Bit 4 is unused. Age stores
;;; the minor version in bits 0-2, and the major version in the remaining 5
;;; bits.
;;;
;;; To find which entry in **CHARACTER-MISC-DATABASE** encodes a character's
;;; attributes, first index **CHARACTER-HIGH-PAGES** (an array of 16-bit
;;; values) with the high 13 bits of the character's codepoint. If the result
;;; value has its high bit set, the character is in a "compressed page". To
;;; find the misc entry number, simply clear the high bit. If the high bit is
;;; not set, the misc entry number must be looked up in
;;; **CHARACTER-LOW-PAGES**, which is an array of 16-bit values. Each entry in
;;; the array consists of two such values, the misc entry number and the
;;; decomposition index. To find the misc entry number, index into
;;; **CHARACTER-LOW-PAGES** using the value retreived from
;;; **CHARACTER-HIGH-PAGES** (shifted left 8 bits) plus the low 8 bits of the
;;; codepoint, all times two to account for the widtth of the entries. The
;;; value in **CHARACTER-LOW-PAGES** at this point is the misc entry number. To
;;; transform a misc entry number into an index into
;;; **CHARACTER-MISC-DATABASE**, multiply it by +misc-width*. This gives the
;;; index of the start of the charater's misc entry in
;;; **CHARACTER-MISC-DATABASE**.
;;;
;;; To look up a character's decomposition, first retreive its
;;; decomposition-info from the misc database as described above. If the
;;; decomposition info is not 0, the character has a decomposition with a
;;; length given by the decomposition info with the high bit (which indicates
;;; compatibility/canonical status) cleared. To find the decomposition, move
;;; one value past the character's misc entry number in
;;; **CHARACTER-LOW-DATABASE**, which gives an index into
;;; **CHARACTER-DECOMPOSITIONS**. The next LENGTH values in
;;; **CHARACTER-DECOMPOSITIONS** (an array of codepoints), starting at this
;;; index, are the decomposition of the character. This proceduce does not
;;; apply to Hangul syllables, which have their own decomposition algorithm.
;;;
;;; Case information is stored in **CHARACTER-CASES**, an array that
;;; indirectly maps a character's codepoint to (cons uppercase
;;; lowercase). Uppercase and lowercase are either a single codepoint,
;;; which is the upper- or lower-case of the given character, or a
;;; list of codepoints which taken as a whole are the upper- or
;;; lower-case. These case lists are only used in Unicode case
;;; transformations, not in Common Lisp ones.
;;;
;;; Similarly, composition information is stored in **CHARACTER-COMPOSITIONS**,
;;; which is a hash table of codepoints indexed by (+ (ash codepoint1 21)
;;; codepoint2).
